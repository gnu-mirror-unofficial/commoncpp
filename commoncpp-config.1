.SH DESCRIPTION
.B commoncpp-config
is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and
linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the
.BR common c++

instead!
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --version
Print the currently installed version of
.B common c++
on the standard output.
.TP
.B --includes
Print the include directory for
.BR common c++
headers
.TP
.B --libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program with
.BR common c++
.TP
.B --cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program with
.BR common c++
.TP
.BI  --prefix= PREFIX
If specified, use
.I PREFIX
instead of the installation prefix that
.B common c++
was built with when computing the output for the
.B --cflags
and
.B --libs
options. This option is also used for the exec prefix if
.B --exec-prefix
was not specified. This option must be specified before any
.B --libs
or
.B --cflags
options.
