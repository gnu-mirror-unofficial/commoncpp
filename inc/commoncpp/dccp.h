/**
 * DCCP sockets are used for stream based connected sessions between two
 * sockets.  Both error recovery and flow control operate transparently
 * for a DCCP socket connection.  The DCCP socket base class is used both
 * for client connections and to bind a DCCP "server" for accepting DCCP
 * streams.
 *
 * An implicit and unique DCCPSocket object exists in Common C++ to represent
 * a bound DCCP socket acting as a "server" for receiving connection requests.
 * This class is not part of DCCPStream because such objects normally perform
 * no physical I/O (read or write operations) other than to specify a listen
 * backlog queue and perform "accept" operations for pending connections.
 * The Common C++ DCCPSocket offers a Peek method to examine where the next
 * pending connection is coming from, and a Reject method to flush the next
 * request from the queue without having to create a session.
 *
 * The DCCPSocket also supports a "OnAccept" method which can be called when a
 * DCCPStream related object is created from a DCCPSocket.  By creating a
 * DCCPStream from a DCCPSocket, an accept operation automatically occurs, and
 * the DCCPSocket can then still reject the client connection through the
 * return status of it's OnAccept method.
