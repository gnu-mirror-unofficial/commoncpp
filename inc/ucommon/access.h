 * Locking protocol classes for member function automatic operations.

 * common virtual base classes which can be used with automatic objects.
 * These classes are related to "protocols" and are used in conjunction
 * with smart pointer/referencing classes.  The access interface supports
 * member functions to acquire a lock when entered and automatically
 * release the lock when the member function returns that are used in
 * conjunction with special referencing smart pointers.
