/**
 * @short A portable C++ threading library for embedded applications.
 * GNU uCommon C++ is meant as a very light-weight library to facilitate using
 * C++ design patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for
 * systems using uclibc along with posix threading support.  For this reason,
 * uCommon disables language features that consume memory or introduce runtime
 * overhead, such as rtti and exception handling, and assumes one will mostly
 * be linking applications with other pure C based libraries rather than using
 * the overhead of the standard C++ library and other class frameworks.
 *
 * uCommon by default does build with support for the bloated ansi standard c++
 * library unless this is changed at configure time with the --disable-stdcpp
 * option.  This is to assure maximum portability and will be used to merge
 * uCommon with GNU Common C++ to form GNU Common C++ 2.0.  Some specific
 * features are tested for when stdc++ is enabled, and these will be used
 * to add back in GNU Common C++ classes such as TCP Stream and serialization.
 *
 * uCommon introduces some Objective-C based design patterns, such as reference
 * counted objects, memory pools, smart pointers, and offers dynamic typing
 * through very light use of inline templates for pure type translation that are
 * then tied to concrete base classes to avoid template instantiation issues.  C++
 * auto-variable automation is also used to enable referenced objects to be
 * deleted and threading locks to be released that are acquired automatically when
 * methods return rather than requiring one to explicitly code for these things.
 *
 * uCommon depends on and when necessary will introduce some portable C
 * replacement functions, especially for sockets, such as adding getaddrinfo for
 * platforms which do not have it, or when threadsafe versions of existing C
 * library functions are needed.  Basic socket support for connecting to named
 * destinations and multicast addresses, and binding to interfaces with IPV4 and
 * IPV6 addresses is directly supported.  Support for high resolution timing and
 * Posix realtime clocks are also used when available.
 *
 * uCommon builds all higher level thread synchronization objects directly from
 * conditionals.  Hence, on platforms which for example do not have rwlocks,
 * barriers, or semaphores, these are still found in uCommon.  A common and
 * consistent call methodology is used for all locks, whether mutex, rw, or
 * semaphore, based on whether used for exclusive or "shared" locking.
 *
 * uCommon requires some knowledge of compiler switches and options to disable
 * language features, the C++ runtime and stdlibs, and associated C++ headers. The
 * current version supports compiling with GCC, which is commonly found on
 * GNU/Linux, OS/X, BSD based systems, and many other platforms; and the Sun
 * Workshop compiler, which is offered as an example how to adapt uCommon for
 * additional compilers. uCommon may also be built with GCC cross compiling for
 * mingw32 to build threaded applications for Microsoft Windows targets nativiely.
 *
 * The minimum platform support for uCommon is a modern and working posix
 * pthread threading library.  I further use a subset of posix threads to assure
 * wider portability by avoiding more specialized features like process shared
 * synchronization objects, pthread rwlocks and pthread semaphores, as these are
 * not implemented on all platforms that I have found.  Finally, I have
 * eliminated the use of posix thread cancellation.
