.SH NAME
zerofill \- clear unused disk space and blank devices.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zerofill
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ devices ]
.I ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is a relative of nullfile.  Like nullfile, it can be used
to write all unused disk space with '0', thereby making file systems that
are stored on virtual machines easier to pack.  In addition, zerofill can
fill unused disk space with random data before zeroing, which can be useful
to remove forensic trace of deleted files.  Finally, zerofile can be told
to operate on and zero (erase) complete disk devices.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-\-random= count
Number of passes to use writing random data before wiping data.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Outputs help screen for the user.
